	<h1>Privacy Policy for SmartButtonControl</h1>
	<p>
		SmartButtonControl is a lightweight desktop utility designed to enhance the Windows user experience by providing quick access to essential system information and actions. It displays the current time in 12- or 24-hour format, indicates the status of Caps Lock and network connection, and allows users to select and display their preferred input language. The application also offers quick access to power options such as Sleep, Restart, and Shut Down.
	</p>

	<h2>Data Collection and Usage</h2>
	<p>
		SmartButtonControl does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or transmit any personal data or user activity. The application operates entirely on the userâ€™s local device and does not connect to any external servers or services.
	</p>

	<h2>Permissions</h2>
	<p>
		The application requires permission to run with full trust in order to perform system-level operations such as switching network connections, and initiating system shutdown, restart, or sleep mode. These actions are only available when explicitly selected by the user. No data is accessed or transmitted beyond what is necessary for these functions.

	</p>
	
	<h2>System Compatibility</h2>
	<p>
		On systems with restricted environments such as Windows 10/11 in S mode, certain system functions (e.g., Sleep, Restart, Shut Down, and network toggling) may not be supported. The app automatically disables unsupported features to prevent any disruption in usage.
	</p>

	<h2>Flag Display Feature</h2>
	<p>
		To enable the optional feature of displaying input languages as country flags, the application automatically creates a folder named <code>C:\Flags</code> if it does not already exist. Users may manually add flag images to this folder. These images are stored locally and used solely for visual representation on the user's own system. They are never uploaded or shared.
	</p>
